Nidhogg will apply numbers from 1-3 to all players as well as one of three debuffs. Once the respective debuff next to the timer ticks down to 0, the player will be hit with a small aoe, become afflicted with a 12s Fire Resistance Down debuff, a 2s Physical Vuln Up, and spawn a tower in a location dependent on their Jump debuff.

These towers need to be soaked by another player without a Fire Resistance Down and will additionally inflict a 12s Fire Resistance Down to the soaker. Once these towers are soaked, they will spawn a clone that will point toward the closest person and cast Geirskogul, a line AoE. These will need to be baited away from the party by the soaker.

Players with First in Line will need to drop their Jump & towers away from the party, then players with Third in Line need to soak the towers left behind, then safely bait the resulting clone Geirskogul cast away from the party.
