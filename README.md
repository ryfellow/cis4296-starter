The library management system is an open-source project and is designed based on the characteristics of JAVA object-oriented programming. The library management system can complete the basic functions of borrowing and returning books. There are four important classes in this project:

Borrower: The main functions are to search for books by subject and author, and check the current borrowing list
Checkout Clerk: Renew the borrower, update the borrower information, add new borrowers, sign for borrowed books, etc., check-in (waiting for implement), check-out (waiting for implement)
Librarian: classify books (waiting for implement), with the function of borrower and Checkout Clerk, check-in (waiting for implement), check-out (waiting for implement)
Administrator: Staff management, check book usage records, check books in the library, fine management (waiting for implement)

By connecting to the Java DB (Derby) Database of NetBeans to obtain the database for book management. (waiting for implement)

# Project Relevance:
The library management system is a beginner friendly open-source project, which is very suitable for beginners who try to contribute to an open-source project for the first time. The learning goals of this project include understanding how to access the database, implementing new functions on the basic borrowing, and returning functions using Object Oriented Design.

# Proposed Contribution:
Conceive new functions for each class according to the existing logical architecture. For example, the introduction of check-in, check-out to the employee's class to record working time as a performance appraisal. Provides e-book rental services for borrowers and can send connections to the borrowersâ€™ electronic devices.
